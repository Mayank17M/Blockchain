## Blockchain

A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies, most notably bitcoin.

This blockchain was created using [SHA-256](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256) which is a member of [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms).
